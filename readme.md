## Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Django (3.0 or higher)
- Agora Developer Account (API Key and App ID)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-calling-app.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open `your_project/settings.py` and update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list to include your development server's IP or domain.

5. Replace `YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID` in `your_app/views.py` with your Agora App ID. It's recommended to use environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys.

6. Run migrations to set up the database:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Access the app in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and test the video calling functionality.

## Changing Agora API Key

For security reasons, you should never hardcode sensitive information like API keys directly in your code. To change the Agora API key in the `views.py` file, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.

2. Add your Agora App ID and API Key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   AGORA_APP_ID=your_app_id
   AGORA_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

3. Update the `views.py` file to use these environment variables:
   ```python
   import os

   agora_app_id = os.environ.get('AGORA_APP_ID')
   agora_api_key = os.environ.get('AGORA_API_KEY')

   # Use agora_app_id and agora_api_key in your code
   ```

By using environment variables, you keep your sensitive information secure and separate from your codebase.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a video calling app using Agora and Django. Users can now enjoy making video calls through your web application.
